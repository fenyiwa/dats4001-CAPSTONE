# Capstone Week 1 Update

**Project Topic:** BCL11A isoforms as genomic modifiers of sickle cell disease severity through regulation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF).

## Progress This Week
- Collected 10 BCL11A transcript sequences from GenBank and organized them into a combined FASTA file.
- Wrote and ran a Python summarizer script to generate sequence-level statistics (length, GC%, N count, isoform tags).
- Produced outputs: `seq_summary.csv` (detailed per-sequence info) and `summary.md` (aggregate overview).
- Began literature review: summarized 5 key papers linking BCL11A variation, HbF levels, and clinical outcomes in sickle cell disease.

## Observations
- Sequences ranged from 429 to 6102 nucleotides, median length 3983.
- Isoform tags were automatically detected for 3 sequences (XL, L, S), while 7 remain unlabeled and will need manual curation.
- Literature shows BCL11A consistently acts as a major regulator of HbF, with both common SNPs and enhancer haplotypes influencing disease severity.

## Next Steps
- Expand literature review with additional sources.
- Explore alignments to compare isoform differences.
- Begin searching for expression datasets linking isoforms to HbF regulation.
