# Week 2 Update

This week was a bit slower, but I still made some progress. I spent more time on the literature review, and while I’ve found some useful insights, I’ve also realized just how much jargon there is in these papers. A lot of the language feels like a barrier, so I’ve been pausing often to look things up and slowly piece everything together. It’s frustrating at times, but I can tell I’m starting to understand more with each pass.

I also met with Professor Keith Crandall from Bioinformatics to talk through my project. That conversation helped a lot — he reminded me not to get too lost in the weeds and to keep thinking about what’s going to make the project both doable and meaningful. Having that outside perspective made me feel a bit more grounded.

Lastly, I’ve been thinking through what methods will actually make sense for me to use. The goal is to find an approach that’s efficient but still gives me real insight, so I’ve started narrowing down my options. It feels like I’m moving from just gathering info toward actually shaping the direction of the project.

**Next Steps:**  
- Keep working through the tricky jargon in the literature.  
- Narrow down methods into a concrete plan.  
- Stay focused on balancing depth with feasibility.
