# Week 8 Update

### Progress Summary
This week, I started creating visualizations in RStudio and explored different ways to represent the allele frequency data across my four modifier genes. I spent time poking through some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and began writing short reflections on the patterns I observed in each dataset.

### Reflections
After completing most of the EDA, I realized that there’s still more work to be done before moving into modeling. I’m running into some uncertainty around model selection and how best to structure the predictive component of the project. To address this, I’ve scheduled a meeting with my bioinformatics professor to go over my approach and decide on the next steps.

### Next Steps
I plan to meet with my professor on **Friday** to discuss the current progress, get clarity on model selection, and outline the workflow for the predictive analysis moving forward.
