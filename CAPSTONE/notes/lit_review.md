# Literature Review: BCL11A and HbF Modulation in Sickle Cell Disease

## 1. Nkya et al. (2020)
- **Question:** Which rare/common variants and pathways distinguish SCD patients with very high vs. very low HbF?
- **Methods:** Targeted sequencing of HbF-associated loci (BCL11A, MYB, HBG1/2, CHD4, KLF1, MBD3) in Tanzanian SCD patients at HbF extremes.
- **Key findings:** High-HbF individuals showed more deletions; indels distinguished high vs. low HbF; variants enriched in epigenetic regulators (NuRD-related genes CHD4, MBD3).
- **Relevance:** Supports chromatin-level control of HbF, showing that BCL11A works within larger epigenetic networks.

## 2. Lettre et al. (2008)
- **Question:** Do SNPs at BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and β-globin loci explain HbF variability and SCD severity?
- **Methods:** Genotyping across two large SCD cohorts (CSSCD and Brazil); association with HbF and pain crises.
- **Key findings:** SNPs at BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and HBB explain >20% of HbF variation; HbF-raising alleles linked to reduced pain-crisis rates.
- **Relevance:** Established BCL11A as a major HbF regulator with clear clinical impact.

## 3. Fanis et al. (2014)
- **Question:** Can HbF-modifying SNPs at BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB be efficiently genotyped?
- **Methods:** Developed multiplex SNaPshot assays for 12 BCL11A and 16 HMIP SNPs.
- **Key findings:** Accurate, cost- and time-efficient genotyping feasible for population/clinical studies.
- **Relevance:** Provides technical tools for linking BCL11A variation to HbF outcomes in research and clinical practice.

## 4. Brahim et al. (2024)
- **Question:** Do BCL11A SNPs associate with HbF in Mauritanian HbSS patients?
- **Methods:** Sequenced three SNPs in 50 patients; association with HbF levels.
- **Key findings:** rs4671393 significantly associated with higher HbF; population-specific allele frequencies observed.
- **Relevance:** Confirms BCL11A’s modifier role in a North-West African cohort, highlighting importance of studying underrepresented groups.

## 5. Sebastiani et al. (2015)
- **Question:** Do BCL11A enhancer haplotypes explain HbF differences across SCD populations?
- **Methods:** Genotyped/imputed six enhancer SNPs across African American, Saudi, and Indian cohorts.
- **Key findings:** Four enhancer SNPs consistently associated with HbF; haplotypes explained ~6% HbF differences; not sufficient to explain all population variation.
- **Relevance:** Shows enhancer-level regulation of BCL11A influences HbF but is not the sole factor, motivating isoform-level analysis.

## Synthesis
Across these studies, **BCL11A consistently emerges as a major trans-acting regulator of HbF**. Genetic variants at BCL11A and related loci explain significant variation in HbF and disease severity, but enhancer haplotypes and chromatin regulators suggest a more complex regulatory landscape. Population-specific studies highlight variation across African and non-African cohorts. For this project, a novel angle lies in analyzing **BCL11A isoforms (XL, L, S, XS)** to connect sequence-level diversity with known genetic modifiers and explore whether structural differences between isoforms could help explain variability in HbF repression and clinical outcomes.
